How to compile:

Rkom needs the following programs to compile. Some of them may be included
in your system, some may not. I have putten some of them together in 
small tar files to make it simpler to compile. Needed are:
	gcc and friends
	flex (needed by spcgen, AT&T lex won't work)
	spcgen (ftp://subzero.campus.luth.se/pub/spcgen/spcgen-1.1.tar.gz)
	pmake (ftp://bakfull.campus.luth.se/rkom/pmake.tgz)
	libedit (ftp://bakfull.campus.luth.se/rkom/libedit.tgz)


NetBSD:
FreeBSD:
	Just unpack the distribution and compile.

OpenBSD:
BSDI:
	Haven't tried, but should "just work".

Linux:
	Tested under Debian /w libc6.
	- Install pmake, available in a package.
	- Fetch, compile and install spcgen from the address above.
	- Fetch libedit from the address above and compile it.
	- Uncomment the following flags in the top-level Makefile.inc:
		NOGCCERROR=1
		LDADD+=-L../../libedit (or the place where libedit is)
		CPPFLAGS+=-I../../libedit
	- Just compile.
SunOS4:
	Gcc and flex must be installed first.
